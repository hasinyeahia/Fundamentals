# Fundamentals of Data Science Final Project

### Instructions

1) Install Python and Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda installation in recommended), as 
    well as tensorflow, keras, opencv dependencies.
    
2) Images must be organized in folders by normalized classification in both the 
    "Data Images" and "TestImages" folders (not included in repository due to size).

3) Models are already trained. If you wish to retrain them, then for each 
    antibiotic (Carbenicillin / Tobramycin):
    1) Run all cells in the corresponding preprocessing notebook
    2) Run all cells in the corresponding model trainer notebook
    
4) Accuracy results are available in the "results" subdirectory. To re-test the 
    classification accuracy for individual models, run the corresponding test notebooks. 

5) To receive classifications on the total original image dataset, run the 
    "Resistance Classification on Total Image Dataset" notebook. The full bacteria 
    dataset must be in "testImages/Bacteria" (not included in repository due to size).
