# Fundamentals of Data Science Final Project

### Instructions

1) Install Python and Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda installation in recommended), as 
    well as tensorflow, keras, opencv dependencies.
    
2) Models are already trained. If you wish to retrain them:
    1) Download the "Data Images" folder linked below.
    2) Place the "Data Images" folder in the project root ("Fundamentals" folder).
    3) For each antibiotic (Carbenicillin / Tobramycin):
        1) Run all cells in the corresponding preprocessing notebook.
        2) Run all cells in the corresponding model trainer notebook.
      
3) Accuracy results are available in the "results" subdirectory. To re-test the 
    classification accuracy for individual models:
    1) Download the "Data Images" folder linked below.
    2) Place the "Data Images" folder in the project root ("Fundamentals" folder). 
    3) Run the corresponding test notebooks. 
    
4) Classification of all images in the bacteria dataset are available in the "results" 
    subdirectory. To re-determine classifications on the total original image dataset:
    1) Download the full bacteria dataset, and place all images into a new "Bacteria" 
        folder in the project root ("Fundamentals" folder).
    2) Run the "Resistance Classification on Total Image Dataset" notebook.
